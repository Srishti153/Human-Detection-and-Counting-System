# Human-Detection-and-Counting-System
This is an intermediate level project where we used HOG and OpenCV to generate an efficient people counter. In this, we can supply the input as: video, image, or even live camera and the program will tell us the number of people in the frame highlighting each person with a rectangular box around it.
